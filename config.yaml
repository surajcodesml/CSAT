  num_decoder_layers: 6
  nheads: 8
  num_queries: 100  # Increased from 48 to detect more objects (helps with FN)
  num_classes: 2
  dropout: 0.1

# Training Parameters
training:
  epochs: 80  # Increased from 40 - model needs more time to learn

  val_batch_size: 64
  learning_rate: 0.0002  # Increased from 0.0001 for faster initial learning
  weight_decay: 0.0001
  
  # Learning rate scheduler
  lr_scheduler:
    type: 'ReduceLROnPlateau'
    patience: 5  # Increased from 2 - give model more time before reducing LR
    cooldown: 3   # Increased from 2
    factor: 0.5   # Changed from 0.1 - gentler LR reduction
    mode: 'min'
